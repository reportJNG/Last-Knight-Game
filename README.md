Core Gameplay

The player has only three actions:

Attack
Deliberate, slow, and fully committal.
Every strike is a decision—greed is punished.

Dodge
Precision over panic.
Dodge too early or too late, and you will be hit.

Parry
High risk, high reward.
Perfect timing breaks enemy momentum and creates rare openings.

There is no button mashing.
Every action consumes stamina, forcing the player to think before acting.

Healing

Healing is limited and dangerous:

Potions are finite during each fight

Using a potion leaves the player briefly vulnerable

Healing is a tactical choice, not a safety net

Survival depends on timing, not forgiveness.

Boss Structure

The game features 5 unique bosses, each designed to teach mastery through failure:

Every boss has distinct patterns and rhythm

Panic dodging is punished

Greedy attacks are punished

Observation and patience are rewarded

Each victory feels earned, not granted.

Design Philosophy

No tutorials holding the player’s hand

Failure is part of learning

Progress comes from understanding patterns, not increasing numbers

A pure souls-like experience, stripped down to its essence—
brutal by design, perfectly suited for the web, and deeply satisfying to overcome.
