# THREE ACTIONS. NO MERCY.

A minimalist souls-like web game focused on timing, consequence, and mastery.  
There are no shortcuts, no button mashing, and no forgiveness—only understanding.

---

## Core Gameplay

The player has only **three actions**. Every choice matters.

### Attack
Slow and fully committal.  
Every strike is a decision—greed is punished.

### Dodge
Precision over panic.  
Dodge too early or too late, and you will be hit.

### Parry
High risk, high reward.  
Perfect timing breaks enemy momentum and creates rare openings.

There is **no button mashing**.  
Every action consumes stamina, forcing deliberate play.

## Healing

Healing is **limited and dangerous**:

- Potions are finite per fight  
- Using a potion leaves the player briefly vulnerable  
- Healing is a tactical decision, not a safety net  

Survival depends on **timing**, not forgiveness.

---

## Boss Structure

The game features **5 unique bosses**, each designed to teach mastery through failure:

- Each boss has distinct patterns and rhythm  
- Panic dodging is punished  
- Greedy attacks are punished  
- Observation and patience are rewarded  

Every victory feels **earned**, never given.

## Design Philosophy

- No hand-holding tutorials  
- Failure is part of learning  
- Progress comes from understanding patterns, not increasing numbers  

A **pure souls-like experience**, stripped down to its essence—  
brutal by design, perfectly suited for the web, and deeply satisfying to overcome.
