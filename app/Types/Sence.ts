He was meant to die long ago.Struck down in war, buried beneath blood and ash, the world believed his story had ended.Yet death refused to claim him. He rose from the battlefield scarred, broken, and changed —a survivor of wars that erased kingdoms and devoured legends.His reward was not peace, but chains.Branded a threat by those he once fought for,he spent the remainder of his life locked behind stone walls and iron bars. Years turned into decades.Hope faded. Truth was buried deeper than his wounds. The world moved on, rewriting history and erasing his name.But time does not kill purpose.Now the prison gates stand open,and the past calls his blood once more. The lies that shaped his fate begin to crack,and the truth waits at the end of a path soaked in sacrifice.This time, he does not rise to serve a crown or a cause.He rises to reclaim his destiny.`;
